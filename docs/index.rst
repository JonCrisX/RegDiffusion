RegDiffusion
=============

RegDiffusion is a very fast regulatory network inference algorithm based on 
probabilistic diffusion model. It works well on genes and is capable to predict 
biologically verifiable links from single cell RNA-seq data.

Inference on networks with 15,000 genes takes under 5 minutes with modern 
accelerated computing.
