# RegDiffusion: Probabilistic Diffusion-Based Neural Inference of Gene Regulatory Networks

Welcome to the official repository for RegDiffusion, an innovative and high-performance approach for inferring Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) from single-cell RNA sequencing data. RegDiffusion leverages the principles of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models to predict regulatory interactions with lifted performance and efficiency.

The details of RegDiffusion is described in the following paper.
